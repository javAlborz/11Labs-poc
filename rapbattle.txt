Female voice:
YOU'RE A BOXER, TELL ME WHY I'M HERE TO KNOCK YOU OUT
YOUR GUNS AIN'T GOT NOTHING ON ME, YOU LITTLE BOY SCOUT
YOU RAMBLE ALL DAY, THINKING YOU'RE DA KILLER
BUT ALL YOU SAY IS EMPTY WORDS, WORTHLESS, LIKE NARUTO FILLER

YOU SAY YOU DON'T GET SICK, YET ALL YOU DO IS WHINE
YOU COME TO ME AND BICKER LIKE I'M YOUR ONLY LIFE LINE
YOU WALK SO SLOW, AND YET YOU CAUGHT A BABE LIKE ME
I TOLERATE ALL YOUR QUIRKS AND YOUR ACCENT, YOU MUST BE LUCKY

YOU THINK YOU'RE SO STRONG BUT IT'S ALL PROTEIN POWDER
MY SISTER AND I HAVE WAAAAY MORE ARM POWER
YOUR NOSE IS SO CROCKED IT NEEDS ITS' OWN RULER
UHH, YOU JUST GOT BURNED, HONEY, DO YOU NEED A COOLER?

Male voice:
YOU CLAIM YOU'RE A DESIGNER YET YOU DRESS LIKE A HOBO
YOU GET DRESSED EVERY DAY AND I'M LIKE "HONEY, THAT'S A NO GO"
ACT ALL HIGH AND MIGHTY, LIKE YOU'RE THE QUEEN BEE
REMEMBER WHEN YOU CHASED ME DOWN LIKE "ALBORZ PLEASE GO OUT WITH ME"

YOU'RE SO PALE, PAPER SEES YOU AS A COMPETITION
I'M A SUPER HUMAN, OPTIMISED THROUGH MY NUTRITION
YOUR LANGUAGE SOUNDS WORSE THAN JABBA THE HUT
MINE FLOWS SMOOTH LIKE WHEN I DELIVER AN UPPER CUT

YOU SAY MY NOSE IS CROOKED, WELL I WAS AMBUSHED
YOUR NOSE LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE BUTTON, READY TO BE PUSHED
GO AHEAD YOU CAN DISS ME FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
BUT THE JOKE IS ON YOU, CAUSE NOW AND FOREVER YOU'RE MY WIFE
